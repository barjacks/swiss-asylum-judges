# Biased Swiss Judges

## Analyzing 30'000 verdicts on deportation appeals by the Swiss Federal Administrative Court.

- For many years now lawyers and attorneys have sensed that cases of migrants appealing deportation weren't treated equally by the 24 judges of the [Swiss Federal Administrative Court](http://www.bvger.ch/index.html?lang=en). To explore this claim we scraped the 30'000 verdicts of the court since 2007 from the court's data base. Then used the Python libraries [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [glob](https://docs.python.org/2/library/glob.html) to explore what the data says.

- The article with our findings was published on 10.10.2016 in the [Tages-Anzeiger](http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch). You'll find the PDF in this repository. Along with the code and regular expressions we used to query the 30'000 text files.

- We haven't published the entire text files here as they are 700MB. You'll find an example of one of the files in the repository. If you require them, please get in touch.

- If you have problems viewing the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) 'Analysing 30000 Verdicts.ipynb' view the raw version of the file, download it on to your device. Then open it locally.
